    "Description": "TalkArena is an interactive platform designed to benchmark Large Audio Models (AudioLLMs) through real-world user interactions. Similar to Chatbot Arena for text-based models, TalkArena allows users to input audio prompts and receive text-based responses from various state-of-the-art models, facilitating pairwise comparisons and user preference evaluations. The platform supports models such as GPT-4o, Gemini, Qwen2-Audio, DiVA-Llama 3, and Typhoon-Audio, enabling comprehensive assessments of their performance in natural, conversational settings."
