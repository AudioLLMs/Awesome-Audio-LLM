    "Description": "GAMA is a General-purpose Large Audio-Language Model (LALM) designed to enhance audio understanding and complex reasoning abilities. It integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) with multiple types of audio representations, including features from a custom Audio Q-Former and a multi-layer aggregator that processes features from various layers of an audio encoder. Fine-tuned on a large-scale audio-language dataset, GAMA is equipped with advanced audio understanding capabilities. Additionally, it employs CompA-R, a synthetically generated instruction-tuning dataset, to endow the model with complex reasoning abilities, particularly for open-ended audio question-answering tasks. GAMA outperforms existing LALMs across diverse audio understanding tasks, demonstrating superior performance in both automated and expert human evaluations."
